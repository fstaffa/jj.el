    - Ensure no external dependencies required (no jj binary)
    - Test infrastructure ready for future test additions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature tests pass (approximately 10-12 tests total)
- Maximum 2 additional tests added if critical gaps found
- Test execution completes in under 1 second
- Tests run without jj binary installed
- Documentation added to test files
- Test infrastructure is ready for future expansion
- New contributors can easily add tests following established patterns

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. Test Infrastructure Setup (Task Group 1) - Foundation for all testing
2. Test Fixtures Creation (Task Group 2) - Sample data for tests
3. Core Function Tests (Task Group 3) - Actual test implementation
4. Integration and Validation (Task Group 4) - Finalization and documentation

## Testing Constraints

- **Maximum total tests**: 10-12 tests for entire feature
- **Test execution time**: Must complete in under 1 second
- **No external dependencies**: Tests must NOT require jj binary installation
- **Isolation**: Each test runs in complete isolation (temp directories, mocked commands)
- **Mocking strategy**: Use `cl-letf` for inline mocking, avoid external mocking libraries
- **Focus on core functions**: Test only parsing, utility, and command construction logic
- **Defer error handling**: Do NOT test error cases unless business-critical
- **No integration tests**: All tests are unit tests with mocked external dependencies

## Success Metrics

- [x] `eask test` command runs successfully
- [x] All 10-12 tests pass
- [x] Test suite executes in under 1 second
- [x] Tests run without jj binary on system
- [x] Test helpers are reusable for future tests
- [x] Clear documentation for adding new tests
- [x] Test infrastructure is extensible and maintainable
