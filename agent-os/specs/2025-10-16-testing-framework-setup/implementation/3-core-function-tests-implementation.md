# Task 3: Unit Tests for Core Functions

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-testing-framework-setup/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Write focused unit tests (maximum 9 tests) for core jj.el functions to verify critical parsing and utility logic. Tests must use mocking helpers to avoid external dependencies and must not require the jj binary to be installed.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented 9 unit tests covering 4 core functions in jj.el. All tests use the mocking infrastructure from test-helper.el to simulate jj command outputs without requiring the actual jj binary. Tests follow BDD-style naming conventions and are grouped into descriptive test suites using Buttercup's `describe` and `it` blocks.

The implementation also includes enhancements to test-helper.el to stub optional dependencies (evil-define-key and map!) that caused loading errors during test execution. This ensures tests can run cleanly without requiring doom-emacs or evil packages.

## Files Changed/Created

### Modified Files
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` - Replaced dummy test with 9 focused unit tests for core functions
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-helper.el` - Added stub functions for optional dependencies and improved command matching

## Key Implementation Details

### Test Suite 1: jj--get-project-name (2 tests)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 14-21)

Tests the project name extraction logic which parses the project name from a file path.

**Tests:**
1. "should extract project name from path" - Verifies correct extraction from standard path
2. "should handle path with trailing slash" - Ensures trailing slashes are handled properly

**Rationale:** This function is critical for UI display and command execution context. The tests verify the string manipulation logic works correctly for common path formats.

### Test Suite 2: jj--bookmarks-get (3 tests)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 23-47)

Tests the bookmark list parsing which splits command output into a list of bookmark names.

**Tests:**
1. "should parse multiple bookmarks from output" - Uses fixture data to verify parsing of realistic bookmark list
2. "should handle empty bookmark list" - Ensures empty output returns nil rather than erroring
3. "should handle bookmark output with whitespace" - Verifies the `s-split` call correctly omits empty strings

**Rationale:** Bookmark selection is a primary user workflow. Tests ensure the parsing handles both normal operation and edge cases (empty lists, trailing whitespace).

### Test Suite 3: jj--log-count-revs (2 tests)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 49-62)

Tests the revision counting logic used for user prompts before bulk operations.

**Tests:**
1. "should count revisions from log output correctly" - Verifies string length counting for "aaa" returns 3
2. "should handle empty log output as zero revisions" - Ensures empty string returns 0

**Rationale:** This function gates destructive operations by showing users how many revisions will be affected. Accurate counting is business-critical.

### Test Suite 4: jj--run-command (2 tests)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 64-84)

Tests the command construction and execution entry point.

**Tests:**
1. "should construct command with proper arguments" - Captures and verifies the constructed command string
2. "should execute command from project folder" - Verifies default-directory is set correctly

**Rationale:** This is the single entry point for all jj command execution. Tests verify proper command formatting and execution context.

### Optional Dependency Stubs
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-helper.el` (lines 33-42)

Added stub definitions for `evil-define-key` and `map!` macros to prevent loading errors.

**Rationale:** The jj.el source file contains references to doom-emacs and evil packages at file scope. Without stubs, test loading would fail. This approach allows tests to run without requiring these optional packages.

## Test Coverage

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` - 9 unit tests covering 4 core functions

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Complete
- Integration tests: Not applicable (all tests are unit tests)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Empty command outputs (bookmarks, log)
  - Trailing slashes in paths
  - Whitespace in parsed output
  - Zero-length strings

### Manual Testing Performed
Executed full test suite using `eask run script test` command:
- All 9 tests passed
- Execution time: 2.18ms (well under 1 second requirement)
- No jj binary required
- Tests run in complete isolation with mocked commands

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Used meaningful, descriptive test names following "should [behavior] when [condition]" pattern
- Kept test functions small and focused on single behaviors
- Followed consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for Elisp)
- Removed dead code (the original dummy test suite)

**Deviations:** None

### commenting.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Code is self-documenting through clear test names and structure
- Added minimal file-level commentary explaining test purpose
- Did not add inline comments for temporary changes

**Deviations:** None

### test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Wrote minimal tests focused on core user flows (bookmark selection, command execution)
- Tested only critical parsing and utility functions
- Did not test edge cases beyond business-critical scenarios
- Used mocking to isolate units from external dependencies (jj binary)
- Tests execute in milliseconds
- Test names clearly explain what's being tested and expected outcome

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Test Infrastructure
- Uses `jj-test-with-mocked-command` macro from test-helper.el for command mocking
- Uses `jj-test-with-project-folder` macro to mock project directory detection
- Uses `jj-test-load-fixture` function to load realistic test data
- Uses `cl-letf` for inline function mocking when testing command construction

### Test Fixtures
- `sample-bookmarks.txt` - Used in jj--bookmarks-get tests

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Message Output During Tests**
   - Description: The jj--run-command function calls (message cmd-string) which outputs to test console
   - Reason: Source function includes logging that isn't suppressed in test environment
   - Future Consideration: Could mock `message` function in tests to suppress output

2. **Command String Matching**
   - Description: Tests must exactly match command strings including literal newlines in quotes
   - Reason: The s-join function preserves literal newline characters in command construction
   - Future Consideration: Could enhance mocking helper to support regex or substring matching

### Issues
None identified. All tests pass consistently.

## Performance Considerations
Test suite executes in 2.18ms (0.00218 seconds), well below the 1-second requirement. All command execution is mocked, so no external process overhead. Tests run in parallel-safe isolation with no shared state.

## Security Considerations
Tests do not execute any external commands or access the filesystem beyond loading fixture files. All jj command execution is mocked. No security concerns identified.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
Task Group 4 (Test Suite Integration and Documentation) depends on this implementation being complete.

## Notes

### Test Count
Implemented exactly 9 tests (within the 8-10 maximum specified):
- 2 tests for jj--get-project-name
- 3 tests for jj--bookmarks-get
- 2 tests for jj--log-count-revs
- 2 tests for jj--run-command

### Test Execution Command
Tests can be run with: `eask run script test`

The Eask script is defined in the project's Eask file as:
```elisp
(script "test" "eask exec buttercup -L . -L tests tests/")
```

### Mocking Strategy
All tests use `cl-letf` for function mocking, either directly or through the helper macros. This avoids external mocking library dependencies and provides precise control over mocked behavior.

### BDD Style
All tests follow Buttercup's BDD style with:
- `describe` blocks grouping related tests by function
- `it` blocks for individual test cases
- `expect` assertions with descriptive matchers (`:to-equal`)
- Clear, behavior-focused test names
