# Task 3: Refactor jj--log-count-revs Tests

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-test-data-driven-refactor/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Refactor the jj--log-count-revs test suite to use a data-driven approach with plist-based test cases. This task eliminates code duplication by extracting the test logic into a single implementation that iterates over a data table, improving maintainability while preserving all existing test behavior.

## Implementation Summary

Successfully converted the jj--log-count-revs test suite from two duplicate test implementations to a single data-driven implementation using a plist-based test cases table with an explicit dolist loop. The refactoring introduces dynamic command string construction using the `:revset` parameter from each test case, enabling flexible test case definitions while maintaining identical test behavior.

The implementation follows the established pattern from Task Groups 2 and 4, ensuring consistency across the test suite. All verbose Given/When/Then comments were removed and replaced with a concise describe-level comment. Both test cases pass with identical behavior, and the cmd-string is built dynamically using `format` with the revset parameter extracted from each test case.

## Key Implementation Details

### Data-Driven Test Structure
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 134-153)

Converted two duplicate test cases to a single data-driven implementation:

```elisp
(describe "jj--log-count-revs"
  (let ((test-cases
         '((:description "should count revisions from log output correctly"
            :revset "trunk()..main"
            :output "aaa"
            :expected 3)
           (:description "should handle empty log output as zero revisions"
            :revset "trunk()..main"
            :output ""
            :expected 0))))
    (dolist (test-case test-cases)
      (it (plist-get test-case :description)
        (let* ((revset (plist-get test-case :revset))
               (output (plist-get test-case :output))
               (expected (plist-get test-case :expected))
               (cmd-string (format "jj --no-pager --color never log -T '\"a\"' --revisions \"%s\" --no-graph" revset)))
          (jj-test-with-mocked-command
            (list (cons cmd-string output))
            (jj-test-with-project-folder "/tmp/test"
              (expect (jj--log-count-revs revset) :to-equal expected))))))))
```

**Rationale:** This approach eliminates code duplication by extracting the common test logic while preserving the ability to test different scenarios through the data table. The dynamic cmd-string construction using `format` enables flexible revset values per test case.

### Plist Keys Used
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 136-143)

Implemented the following plist structure for each test case:
- `:description` - Test case description displayed in test output
- `:revset` - The revset parameter passed to jj--log-count-revs (e.g., "trunk()..main")
- `:output` - Inline string for command output (e.g., "aaa" or "")
- `:expected` - Expected count of revisions (e.g., 3 or 0)

**Rationale:** This structure provides all necessary data for each test case in a self-documenting format. The `:revset` key enables dynamic command construction, while `:output` provides inline test data for simple string scenarios.

### Dynamic Command String Construction
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (line 149)

Built cmd-string dynamically within the dolist loop using `format`:

```elisp
(cmd-string (format "jj --no-pager --color never log -T '\"a\"' --revisions \"%s\" --no-graph" revset))
```

**Rationale:** Unlike Task Group 2 (bookmarks) where the command string was constant, this test suite requires the revset parameter to be interpolated into the command string. Using `format` enables building the correct command for each test case while maintaining DRY principles.

### Comment Simplification
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 130-132)

Replaced verbose comments with a single concise describe-level comment:

```elisp
;; Test Suite: jj--log-count-revs
;; -------------------------------
;; Test cases for revision counting from log output
```

**Rationale:** Removed all Given/When/Then comments from individual test cases as the data-driven structure and descriptive `:description` keys make the tests self-documenting. The describe-level comment provides context for the entire suite.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this is a testing refactoring with no database schema changes.

Executed the full test suite using `eask run script test`:

```bash
$ eask run script test
Running 9 specs.

jj--get-project-name
  should extract project name from path (0.06ms)
  should handle path with trailing slash (0.05ms)

jj--bookmarks-get
  should parse multiple bookmarks from output (0.13ms)
  should handle empty bookmark list (0.04ms)
  should handle bookmark output with whitespace (0.04ms)

jj--log-count-revs
  should count revisions from log output correctly (0.04ms)
  should handle empty log output as zero revisions (0.04ms)

jj--run-command
  should construct command with proper arguments (0.04ms)
  should execute command from project folder (0.03ms)

Ran 9 specs, 0 failed, in 2.18ms.
```

All 9 tests pass, including the 2 tests in the jj--log-count-revs suite. Test execution completed in 2.18ms, well under the 1-second requirement.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The refactoring strictly follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting duplicate test logic into a single implementation that iterates over a data table. The use of meaningful variable names (revset, output, expected) and the plist structure with descriptive keyword keys makes the code self-documenting and easy to understand.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Tests focus on behavior rather than implementation by validating that jj--log-count-revs correctly counts revisions from log output. All external dependencies are mocked using jj-test-with-mocked-command and jj-test-with-project-folder. Test execution remains extremely fast (under 1ms per test), and test names clearly describe the expected behavior and conditions.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Conventions Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation maintains consistent project structure by keeping all tests in the established test file location. The refactoring follows the data-driven pattern established by previous task groups, ensuring consistency across the test suite. Documentation is comprehensive, including this implementation report and updated tasks.md status.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Commenting Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Comments were simplified by removing verbose Given/When/Then style comments while retaining a clear describe-level comment explaining the purpose of the test suite. The plist data structure with descriptive `:description` keys makes individual test cases self-documenting, reducing the need for inline comments.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable - this is a testing refactoring with no API changes.

### External Services
Not applicable - tests use mocking to avoid external dependencies.

### Internal Dependencies
- `jj-test-with-mocked-command` - Test helper macro for mocking command output
- `jj-test-with-project-folder` - Test helper macro for mocking project folder detection
- `jj--log-count-revs` - Function under test that counts revisions from log output

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified. All tests pass with expected behavior.

### Limitations
None. The refactoring successfully achieves all acceptance criteria.

## Performance Considerations
Test execution remains extremely fast (under 1ms per test case), with the entire jj--log-count-revs suite executing in approximately 0.08ms total. The data-driven approach adds no measurable performance overhead compared to the original implementation.

## Security Considerations
Not applicable - this is a testing refactoring with no security implications.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task is a dependency for Task Group 4 (jj--run-command refactoring), which has already been completed. No additional tasks depend on this implementation.

## Notes

### Key Success Factors
1. **Dynamic Command Construction**: The use of `format` to build cmd-string dynamically was essential for this suite, unlike Task Group 2 which used a constant command string
2. **Consistency with Established Pattern**: Following the plist-based approach from Task Groups 2 and 4 ensured consistency across the test suite
3. **Preserved Test Behavior**: All test assertions pass identically to the original implementation, validating the correctness of the refactoring

### Observations
- The refactoring reduced code duplication from ~28 lines to ~20 lines (approximately 29% reduction)
- Test output remains clear and readable with descriptive test names from `:description` keys
- The data-driven approach makes adding new test cases trivial - simply add a new plist entry to the test-cases list
- Both test cases use the same revset ("trunk()..main"), but the structure supports different revsets per test case if needed

### Next Steps
Task Group 3 is now complete. Task Groups 1, 2, and 4 have also been completed by other implementations. Task Group 5 (Documentation and Final Validation) remains to be implemented.
