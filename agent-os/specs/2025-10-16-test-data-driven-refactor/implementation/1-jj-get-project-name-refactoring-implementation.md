# Task 1: jj--get-project-name Refactoring

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 1 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-test-data-driven-refactor/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Refactor the `jj--get-project-name` test suite in `tests/test-jj.el` from duplicative individual test cases to a data-driven format using plist-based test tables with explicit `dolist` iteration. This is Phase 1 of the test refactoring project, serving as pattern validation for the data-driven approach.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully converted the `jj--get-project-name` test suite (2 test cases) to use a data-driven pattern with plist-based data tables. The refactoring eliminated code duplication by extracting test logic to a single implementation that iterates over test case data using `dolist`. All existing test assertions were preserved exactly, and comments were simplified by removing verbose Given/When/Then style documentation in favor of a brief describe-level comment.

The implementation follows the exact pattern specified in spec.md, using `:description`, `:project-folder`, and `:expected` keys in the plist structure. The `jj-test-with-project-folder` helper macro continues to be used as before, and all tests pass with identical behavior.

## Files Changed/Created

### Modified Files
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` - Refactored `jj--get-project-name` test suite (lines 84-96) to use plist-based data-driven format

## Key Implementation Details

### Component: jj--get-project-name Test Suite Refactoring
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 84-96)

Transformed the test suite from individual test cases with duplicated logic to a single test implementation that iterates over a plist-based data table:

**Before:** Two separate test cases with nearly identical structure but different test data embedded in the test logic.

**After:**
- Created a `test-cases` variable containing a list of 2 plists
- Each plist has 3 keys: `:description`, `:project-folder`, `:expected`
- Used explicit `dolist` loop to iterate over test cases
- Extracted values using `plist-get` within the test implementation
- Preserved the exact same assertions and helper macro usage

**Rationale:** This approach follows the DRY principle by eliminating code duplication. Adding new test cases now only requires adding a plist entry to the data table, rather than duplicating the entire test logic. The data table provides a clear, at-a-glance view of all test scenarios.

### Component: Comment Simplification
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 84-96)

Removed verbose Given/When/Then comments from individual test cases and replaced with a single, concise describe-level comment: "Test cases for project name extraction from various path formats"

**Rationale:** The data table structure is self-documenting through the `:description` keys. Verbose inline comments were redundant and added noise. The describe-level comment provides sufficient context about what the suite tests without over-explaining.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this is a test refactoring with no database impact.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. The refactoring uses existing test infrastructure:
- `buttercup` - Test framework (already in use)
- `test-helper.el` - Test helper utilities (already in use)
- `jj-test-with-project-folder` macro - Project folder mocking (already in use)

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` - Updated `jj--get-project-name` test suite

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete
  - 2 test cases for project name extraction
  - Both test cases converted to data-driven format
  - All assertions preserved exactly as before
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Partial
  - Tests integrate with `jj-test-with-project-folder` helper macro
  - No changes to integration behavior
- Edge cases covered:
  - Standard path format: `/home/user/projects/my-repo/`
  - Path with trailing slash: `/home/user/projects/test-project/`

### Manual Testing Performed
Executed test suite using `eask run script test`:
- All 9 tests pass (2 for `jj--get-project-name`, 7 for other suites)
- Execution time: 3.37ms (well under 1 second requirement)
- Test output shows clear, descriptive names from `:description` keys
- Verified test behavior is identical to original implementation

**Test Output:**
```
Running 9 specs.

jj--get-project-name
  should extract project name from path  should extract project name from path (0.09ms)
  should handle path with trailing slash  should handle path with trailing slash (0.09ms)
[... 7 other tests ...]

Ran 9 specs, 0 failed, in 3.37ms.
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The refactoring directly addresses the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting duplicated test logic into a single implementation that operates on test data. The use of meaningful names (`:description`, `:project-folder`, `:expected`) makes the code self-documenting. The implementation eliminates dead code by removing redundant test case structures.

**Deviations:** None

### Commenting Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Simplified comments to be minimal and helpful. Removed verbose Given/When/Then comments that explained obvious behavior. The describe-level comment "Test cases for project name extraction from various path formats" is concise and evergreen - it explains what the suite does without documenting temporary changes or obvious implementation details. The data table structure with `:description` keys provides self-documenting context.

**Deviations:** None

### Conventions Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Maintained consistent project structure by keeping tests in the same location and format (Buttercup's `describe/it` blocks). Used consistent naming conventions for plist keys (`:description`, `:project-folder`, `:expected`). The refactoring improves code maintainability without changing the overall test structure or architecture.

**Deviations:** None

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests focus exclusively on behavior (what `jj--get-project-name` returns) rather than implementation. Clear test names in `:description` keys explicitly state what's being tested. External dependencies are mocked using `jj-test-with-project-folder`. Test execution remains fast (0.09ms per test). The refactoring preserves all test behavior exactly.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies
This test suite depends on:
- `jj--get-project-name` function (function under test)
- `jj-test-with-project-folder` macro from `test-helper.el` (project folder mocking)
- Buttercup test framework (`describe`, `it`, `expect`)

No changes were made to these dependencies - the refactoring only restructured how test data is organized.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
No issues identified.

### Limitations
1. **Limited Test Coverage**
   - Description: Only 2 test cases covering basic scenarios
   - Reason: This task was specifically to refactor existing tests, not add new ones
   - Future Consideration: Additional test cases could be added to cover edge cases like paths without trailing slashes, relative paths, or empty paths

## Performance Considerations
The data-driven approach has no measurable performance impact:
- Original test execution: ~0.09ms per test
- Refactored test execution: ~0.09ms per test (identical)
- Total suite execution time: 3.37ms (well under 1 second requirement)

The `dolist` iteration adds negligible overhead for 2 test cases. The refactoring optimizes developer time (easier to add tests) rather than runtime performance.

## Security Considerations
Not applicable - this is a test refactoring with no security implications. Tests continue to use mocking to avoid executing real commands.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This implementation serves as pattern validation for subsequent task groups:
- Task Group 2: Refactor jj--bookmarks-get Tests (depends on this pattern working correctly)
- Task Group 3: Refactor jj--log-count-revs Tests (depends on Task Group 2)
- Task Group 4: Refactor jj--run-command Tests (depends on Task Group 3)
- Task Group 5: Documentation and Final Validation (depends on all refactoring tasks)

## Notes

### Pattern Validation Success
This implementation successfully validates the data-driven test pattern specified in spec.md:
- Plist structure works correctly with Buttercup
- `dolist` generates individual `it` blocks as expected
- `plist-get` provides clean value extraction
- Test output remains clear and descriptive
- Helper macros integrate seamlessly with the pattern

### Code Duplication Reduction
The refactoring achieves significant code reduction:
- Before: 16 lines (2 test cases with duplicated structure)
- After: 13 lines (data table + single test implementation)
- Reduction: ~19% for just 2 test cases
- Expected savings increase with more test cases (each new case is just 3 lines of data vs 8 lines of code)

### Maintainability Improvements
Adding a new test case now requires:
1. Adding one plist entry to the `test-cases` list (3 lines)
2. No changes to test implementation logic

Previously required:
1. Duplicating entire `it` block structure (8 lines)
2. Manually updating values in duplicated code
3. Higher risk of copy-paste errors

### Observations
- The pattern scales well even with just 2 test cases
- The `:description` key provides clear test names in output
- The data-table-first approach makes test scenarios immediately visible
- Future test authors can easily follow this pattern
