# Task 2: Refactor jj--bookmarks-get Tests

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-test-data-driven-refactor/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Refactor the jj--bookmarks-get test suite from duplicative individual test cases to a data-driven approach using plist-based test tables with dolist iteration. This task focuses on Phase 2 of the refactoring, handling parsing functions that use both fixture files and inline test data.

## Implementation Summary

Successfully converted the jj--bookmarks-get test suite from three separate `it` blocks with duplicated test logic into a single data-driven structure using a plist-based test-cases table. The refactoring eliminates code duplication by extracting the common test logic into a single implementation and defining test variations as data entries.

The key innovation in this implementation is the conditional handling of both fixture-based and inline output data. The test cases table includes a `:fixture` key for tests that load data from fixture files and an `:output` key for tests with inline string data. The implementation uses conditional logic to load the fixture if present, otherwise using the inline output value.

All three existing tests pass with identical behavior after refactoring, and the common command string was extracted outside the dolist loop to further reduce duplication. Comments were simplified by removing verbose Given/When/Then style comments while preserving the describe-level documentation.

## Key Implementation Details

### Data-Driven Test Structure
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 107-128)

Converted three individual test cases into a plist-based data structure:

```elisp
(let ((test-cases
       '((:description "should parse multiple bookmarks from output"
          :fixture "sample-bookmarks.txt"
          :expected ("dev-branch" "feature-branch" "main"))
         (:description "should handle empty bookmark list"
          :output ""
          :expected nil)
         (:description "should handle bookmark output with whitespace"
          :output "main\n\n"
          :expected ("main"))))
      (cmd-string "jj --no-pager --color never bookmark list -T 'name ++ \"\n\"'"))
```

**Rationale:** This structure eliminates duplication of test logic while making it easy to see all test variations at a glance. The common `cmd-string` is extracted outside the loop since it's constant across all test cases, following the DRY principle.

### Conditional Fixture/Output Handling
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 120-124)

Implemented conditional logic to handle both fixture files and inline output:

```elisp
(let* ((output (if (plist-get test-case :fixture)
                  (jj-test-load-fixture (plist-get test-case :fixture))
                (plist-get test-case :output))))
```

**Rationale:** This pattern allows a single test-cases table to handle both complex multi-line output (loaded from fixtures) and simple inline strings, providing flexibility while maintaining the data-driven approach. The test case with `:fixture` loads from `sample-bookmarks.txt`, while the other two test cases use inline `:output` values.

### Dolist Loop for Test Generation
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 120-128)

Used explicit `dolist` loop to generate `it` blocks from the test-cases table:

```elisp
(dolist (test-case test-cases)
  (it (plist-get test-case :description)
    (let* ((output (if (plist-get test-case :fixture)
                      (jj-test-load-fixture (plist-get test-case :fixture))
                    (plist-get test-case :output))))
      (jj-test-with-mocked-command
        (list (cons cmd-string output))
        (jj-test-with-project-folder "/tmp/test"
          (expect (jj--bookmarks-get) :to-equal (plist-get test-case :expected)))))))
```

**Rationale:** The explicit `dolist` loop iterates through the test cases and generates separate `it` blocks for each, maintaining Buttercup's test output readability while eliminating code duplication. Each generated test uses the `:description` as the test name, ensuring clear test output.

### Comment Simplification
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 107-108)

Removed verbose Given/When/Then comments from individual tests and kept only the essential describe-level comment:

```elisp
(describe "jj--bookmarks-get"
  ;; Test cases for bookmark parsing with various command outputs
```

**Rationale:** The data-driven table structure is self-documenting through the `:description` keys, making verbose inline comments redundant. The concise describe-level comment provides sufficient context about what the test suite covers.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this is a test refactoring with no database components.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. The refactoring uses existing test infrastructure:
- Buttercup test framework (existing)
- `jj-test-with-mocked-command` helper macro (existing)
- `jj-test-with-project-folder` helper macro (existing)
- `jj-test-load-fixture` helper function (existing)

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` - Refactored jj--bookmarks-get test suite

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (all 3 test cases preserved)
- Integration tests: Not applicable (unit test refactoring)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Multiple bookmarks from fixture file
  - Empty bookmark list (empty string output)
  - Whitespace handling (output with extra newlines)

### Manual Testing Performed
Executed the test suite to verify all tests pass:

```bash
$ eask run script test
Running 9 specs.

jj--bookmarks-get
  should parse multiple bookmarks from output ✓ (0.25ms)
  should handle empty bookmark list ✓ (0.08ms)
  should handle bookmark output with whitespace ✓ (0.06ms)

Ran 9 specs, 0 failed, in 2.46ms.
```

All 3 jj--bookmarks-get tests pass with identical behavior to the original implementation. Execution time is 2.46ms, well under the 1-second requirement.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The refactoring follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting the common test logic into a single implementation and defining test variations as data entries. The cmd-string variable is extracted outside the loop since it's constant across all test cases. Small, focused functions are maintained by keeping each test case focused on a single behavior through clear `:description` keys.

**Deviations:** None

### test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation tests behavior (bookmark parsing) rather than implementation details. Test names are clear and descriptive through the `:description` keys ("should parse multiple bookmarks from output", etc.). External dependencies are mocked using the existing helper macros (`jj-test-with-mocked-command`, `jj-test-with-project-folder`). Fast execution is maintained at 2.46ms for the entire suite.

**Deviations:** None

### commenting.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Comments were simplified to focus on high-level purpose rather than implementation details. Verbose Given/When/Then comments were removed since the data-driven structure is self-documenting through descriptive `:description` keys. The describe-level comment succinctly explains what the test suite covers.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Test Helper Functions
- `jj-test-with-mocked-command` - Used to mock command output for all test cases
- `jj-test-with-project-folder` - Used to mock project detection for all test cases
- `jj-test-load-fixture` - Used conditionally to load fixture data for the first test case

### Fixture Files
- `tests/fixtures/sample-bookmarks.txt` - Used by the "should parse multiple bookmarks from output" test case

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified.

### Limitations
None identified. The refactoring successfully handles both fixture-based and inline output data.

## Performance Considerations

The refactored test suite executes in 0.39ms (0.25ms + 0.08ms + 0.06ms) for the three jj--bookmarks-get tests, which is comparable to the original implementation. The data-driven approach adds minimal overhead while significantly improving maintainability.

## Security Considerations

Not applicable - this is a test refactoring with no security implications.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

- Task Group 3 (jj--log-count-revs refactoring) depends on this implementation as part of the sequential refactoring approach
- Task Group 5 (documentation updates) will reference this implementation as an example of the data-driven pattern

## Notes

The conditional handling of `:fixture` vs `:output` keys proved to be a clean pattern for supporting both fixture files and inline test data in a single test-cases table. This pattern can be reused in other test suites that need similar flexibility.

The extraction of `cmd-string` outside the dolist loop was important for eliminating duplication, as all three test cases use the same command. This follows the principle of defining constants at the appropriate scope level.

All three test cases maintain identical behavior to the original implementation, verified through test execution. The test output remains clear and descriptive, showing the test names from the `:description` keys.
