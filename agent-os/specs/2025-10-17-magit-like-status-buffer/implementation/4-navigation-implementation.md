# Task 4: Navigation System

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #4 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-magit-like-status-buffer/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** ui-designer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement navigation system for the jj-status buffer, allowing users to move between files and revisions using n/p keys, and showing diffs (stub) with RET key.

## Implementation Summary

This task implements a navigation system using Emacs text properties to mark items in the status buffer. The implementation adds:

1. A helper function to mark text regions with item data
2. A function to identify what item the cursor is on
3. Navigation commands to move between items
4. A stub diff viewing command
5. Key bindings for all navigation commands

The approach uses the `jj-item` text property to track which buffer regions correspond to files or revisions. Navigation functions scan for these properties to find the next/previous item, wrapping at buffer boundaries.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj-navigation.el` - Navigation system tests (8 focused tests, all passing)

### Modified Files
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` - Added navigation functions and updated rendering functions (lines 575-647 for navigation, lines 439-514 for updated rendering, lines 867-869 for keybindings)

## Key Implementation Details

### Navigation Using Text Properties

**Location:** Lines 575-647 in jj.el

The navigation system uses Emacs text properties to mark buffer regions that correspond to items (files or revisions). When rendering, each item gets a `jj-item` property containing its plist data.

Key functions:
- `jj-status--mark-item-bounds` (line 578-581): Marks text regions with item metadata
- `jj-status--item-at-point` (line 583-593): Returns item type and data at cursor position
- `jj-status-next-item` (line 595-613): Moves to next item with wrapping
- `jj-status-prev-item` (line 615-633): Moves to previous item with wrapping
- `jj-status-show-diff` (line 635-647): Stub for diff viewing (displays placeholder message)

**Rationale:** Text properties provide a clean way to associate metadata with buffer text without modifying the visible content. This approach is standard in Emacs for implementing navigation and allows navigation functions to quickly identify what's under the cursor.

### Item Detection at Point

**Location:** `jj-status--item-at-point` (lines 583-593)

This function checks the `jj-item` property at point and returns a standardized plist indicating whether it's a file, revision, or nothing. Files are identified by having a `:path` property, revisions by having a `:change-id` property.

**Rationale:** Centralizing item detection in one function ensures consistent behavior across all navigation and interaction commands.

### Wrapping Navigation

**Location:** `jj-status-next-item` (lines 595-613) and `jj-status-prev-item` (lines 615-633)

Both functions implement wrapping: when reaching the end/beginning of the buffer without finding an item, they continue searching from the opposite end. If still no item is found, they return to the starting position.

**Rationale:** Wrapping navigation matches Magit behavior and provides a better user experience by avoiding "dead ends" in navigation.

### Updated Rendering Functions

**Location:** Lines 439-514 in jj.el

Two rendering functions were updated to call `jj-status--mark-item-bounds`:
1. `jj-status--render-working-copy` (lines 439-465) - Marks each file entry
2. `jj-status--render-revisions` (lines 467-514) - Marks each revision entry

Both functions capture the starting point before inserting text, then call `jj-status--mark-item-bounds` with the start/end positions and item plist.

### Keybindings

**Location:** Lines 867-869 in jj.el

Three keybindings added to `jj-status-mode-map`:
- `n` - Next item (`jj-status-next-item`)
- `p` - Previous item (`jj-status-prev-item`)
- `RET` - Show diff (`jj-status-show-diff`)

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### No New Dependencies Added

The implementation uses only built-in Emacs functions:
- `put-text-property` - Standard text property manipulation
- `get-text-property` - Text property retrieval
- `forward-line`, `point`, `eobp`, `bobp` - Standard buffer navigation primitives

## Testing

### Test Files Created
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj-navigation.el` - 8 focused tests covering:
  - Text property marking
  - Item detection (files, revisions, empty space)
  - Forward navigation
  - Backward navigation
  - Diff viewing (stub)

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete for navigation primitives
- Integration tests: ✅ All 104 tests pass (including 8 navigation tests)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Navigation when no items exist
  - Navigation at buffer boundaries
  - Wrapping behavior
  - Different item types

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### accessibility.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All navigation features are keyboard-accessible using standard Emacs key conventions (n/p/RET). No mouse interaction is required. Text properties are invisible to screen readers but don't interfere with text reading.

**Deviations:** None

### components.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Navigation functions follow single responsibility principle - each function has one clear purpose (mark bounds, detect item, move next, move previous, show diff). Functions are composable and have clear interfaces.

**Deviations:** None

### coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Functions use consistent naming (`jj-status--` prefix for internal, `jj-status-` for interactive commands). Names are descriptive and reveal intent. Functions are small and focused. No dead code or duplication.

**Deviations:** None

### test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests focus on core user flows (navigation between items). Only 8 focused tests written, not exhaustive coverage. Tests verify behavior, not implementation details. All tests use isolated test buffers to avoid external dependencies.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Modified Functions
- `jj-status--render-working-copy` - Now calls `jj-status--mark-item-bounds` after inserting each file
- `jj-status--render-revisions` - Now calls `jj-status--mark-item-bounds` after inserting each revision

### Internal Dependencies
- Navigation functions depend on text properties being set during rendering
- Rendering functions must call `jj-status--mark-item-bounds` for navigation to work
- Keybindings are registered in `jj-status-mode-map` for the status buffer

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified. All tests pass and navigation works as expected.

### Limitations

1. **Stub Diff Viewing**
   - Description: `jj-status-show-diff` only displays a placeholder message
   - Reason: Actual diff viewing is deferred to roadmap item #5
   - Future Consideration: Will be implemented in future task group

2. **No Section-Aware Navigation**
   - Description: Navigation doesn't distinguish between sections (files vs revisions)
   - Reason: Kept simple for initial implementation per task requirements
   - Future Consideration: Could add section-specific navigation commands if requested

## Performance Considerations

Text property operations are very fast in Emacs. Navigation scans line-by-line which is efficient for typical status buffers (10-100 items). No performance optimizations needed for expected use cases.

## Security Considerations

No security concerns. Navigation functions only read text properties and move point - no file system access or command execution.
