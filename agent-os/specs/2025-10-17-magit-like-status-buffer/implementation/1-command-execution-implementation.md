# Task 1: Command Execution Infrastructure

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-magit-like-status-buffer/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement the command execution layer for the status buffer feature by creating three fetch functions that execute jj commands and return raw output strings. This provides the foundational data collection infrastructure needed for parsing and rendering the magit-like status buffer.

## Implementation Summary
I implemented three command execution functions following the existing `jj--with-command` pattern. Each function executes a specific jj command and returns the raw stdout output as a string. The functions are internal (using `jj-status--` prefix) and reuse the existing error handling infrastructure. I wrote 8 focused tests to verify command execution, return values, and error handling integration. All tests pass successfully.

The implementation follows the established patterns in jj.el, using the `jj--with-command` macro for repository validation and error handling, and returning raw command output that will be parsed by subsequent task groups.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj-status.el` - Test file for magit-like status buffer feature with 8 command execution tests

### Modified Files
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` - Added three new command execution functions (`jj-status--fetch-revision-list`, `jj-status--fetch-working-copy-status`, `jj-status--fetch-bookmark-list`) in a new section before User-Facing Commands

## Key Implementation Details

### jj-status--fetch-revision-list
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` (lines 188-194)

This function executes `jj log` with the `--revisions "immutable_heads()..@"` revset to fetch the revision list, using `--graph` to include ASCII graph characters and a custom template to extract change IDs, descriptions, and bookmarks. The template separates each field with newlines for easier parsing.

**Rationale:** This command provides all the data needed for the Revisions section, including the graph visualization that makes the status buffer Magit-like. The custom template format was chosen to simplify parsing in Task Group 2.

### jj-status--fetch-working-copy-status
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` (lines 196-201)

This function executes the simple `jj status` command to fetch working copy file changes. It follows the exact same pattern as the existing `jj-status` function (lines 212-222) but returns only the raw output instead of creating a buffer.

**Rationale:** Reusing the existing command pattern ensures consistency. The raw output contains file paths and status indicators (A/M/R) needed for the Working Copy section.

### jj-status--fetch-bookmark-list
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` (lines 203-208)

This function executes `jj bookmark list` with a custom template that outputs bookmark names and change IDs separated by tabs. This format matches the pattern used in `jj--bookmarks-get` (lines 256-259) but includes change IDs for the Bookmarks section.

**Rationale:** The tab-separated format is simple to parse and the implementation reuses the established pattern from `jj--bookmarks-get`.

### Test Suite
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj-status.el`

I wrote 8 focused tests (within the 2-8 test guideline) organized by function:
- 3 tests for `jj-status--fetch-revision-list` (command execution, return value, error handling)
- 2 tests for `jj-status--fetch-working-copy-status` (command execution, return value)
- 3 tests for `jj-status--fetch-bookmark-list` (command execution, return value, error handling)

**Rationale:** The tests verify critical functionality without exhaustive coverage. They mock `jj--run-command` to avoid requiring the jj binary and verify that functions execute the correct commands and return raw output strings.

## Database Changes
Not applicable (Emacs Lisp package, no database)

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
None - all functions use existing jj.el infrastructure

### Configuration Changes
None

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj-status.el` - Created with 8 new tests for command execution

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (8 tests covering all three fetch functions)
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Partial (will be added in Task Group 8)
- Edge cases covered: Repository validation, command format verification, return value types

### Manual Testing Performed
Ran all tests using `eask test buttercup`. All 8 new tests for Task Group 1 passed successfully. Verified that:
1. Each function executes the correct jj command
2. Functions return raw string output
3. Functions integrate with `jj--with-command` error handling (validation called)

Test output confirmed:
```
Task Group 1: Command Execution Infrastructure
  jj-status--fetch-revision-list
    ✓ should execute jj log command with graph and custom template
    ✓ should return raw command output string
    ✓ should use jj--with-command for error handling
  jj-status--fetch-working-copy-status
    ✓ should execute jj status command
    ✓ should return raw command output string
  jj-status--fetch-bookmark-list
    ✓ should execute jj bookmark list command with custom template
    ✓ should return raw command output string
    ✓ should use jj--with-command error handling pattern
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### backend/api.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
While this standards file is focused on REST APIs and HTTP endpoints, I followed its core principle of "Consistent Naming" by using consistent function naming conventions (`jj-status--fetch-*`) and returning consistent data types (raw string output) across all three fetch functions.

**Deviations (if any):**
Most of this file's content (RESTful design, HTTP methods, versioning, etc.) is not applicable to Emacs Lisp command execution functions.

### global/coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
I followed all applicable coding style standards: used descriptive function names that reveal intent (`jj-status--fetch-revision-list` clearly indicates it fetches the revision list for status buffer), kept functions small and focused on a single task (each fetch function only executes one command and returns output), applied consistent naming conventions (all use `jj-status--fetch-` prefix), and followed the DRY principle by reusing the `jj--with-command` macro pattern rather than duplicating error handling code.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### global/error-handling.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
I used the existing `jj--with-command` macro which implements centralized error handling at the appropriate boundary (command execution layer). This macro validates preconditions early (repository validation via `jj--validate-repository`), provides user-friendly error messages through `jj--handle-command-error`, and ensures resources are cleaned up in `jj--run-command` using `unwind-protect`. My functions fail fast and explicitly if not in a jj repository.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### testing/test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
I wrote exactly 8 focused tests (within the 2-8 guideline), testing only the core user flow of command execution. I focused on critical paths (command execution and return values) and deferred edge case testing as instructed. Tests are behavior-focused (verifying commands execute correctly) rather than implementation-focused, use clear descriptive names, mock external dependencies (`jj--run-command`), and execute fast (all tests complete in under 2ms).

**Deviations (if any):**
None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable (internal Emacs Lisp functions, not API endpoints)

### External Services
- `jj` CLI binary - Functions execute jj commands via `jj--run-command`

### Internal Dependencies
- `jj--with-command` macro (lines 111-126) - Used for repository validation and error handling
- `jj--validate-repository` (lines 128-136) - Called by `jj--with-command` to validate repository
- `jj--run-command` (lines 79-107) - Low-level command execution
- `jj--handle-command-error` (lines 156-184) - Error handling called on command failure

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None

### Limitations
1. **Synchronous Execution**
   - Description: All commands execute synchronously and block the UI
   - Reason: Initial version prioritizes simplicity; async execution deferred to future enhancement
   - Future Consideration: Could be optimized with asynchronous command execution in the future

2. **No Command Output Caching**
   - Description: Functions execute jj commands every time they're called
   - Reason: Initial implementation focuses on correctness; caching will be added in Task Group 6
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 6 will implement caching during single status view session

## Performance Considerations
Functions execute synchronously with no caching, which is acceptable for initial implementation. Performance optimization will be addressed in Task Group 6 (refresh system) which will implement caching. Expected performance for typical repositories (up to 100 revisions) is under 500ms for all three commands combined.

## Security Considerations
All functions use the existing `jj--run-command` infrastructure which uses `call-process` (not shell evaluation) and properly handles argument separation via `split-string`. Input validation occurs through repository validation in `jj--validate-repository`. The custom templates use quoted strings to prevent injection issues.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task Group 2 (Output Parsing) depends on this implementation to provide raw command output
- Task Group 6 (Buffer Refresh) will integrate these functions into the refresh workflow

## Notes
The implementation strictly follows the existing patterns in jj.el. All three functions use identical structure: wrap command execution in `jj--with-command` and return stdout. This consistency makes the code predictable and maintainable. The custom templates were carefully designed to output data in formats that will be easy to parse in Task Group 2.

Test naming follows Buttercup conventions and clearly describes what each test verifies. The test file is organized with clear section headers and comments explaining the purpose of each test group.
