# Task 3: Buffer Rendering System

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-magit-like-status-buffer/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** ui-designer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement the buffer rendering system for the magit-like status buffer. This includes creating custom faces for styling, implementing section rendering functions for working copy changes, revisions with graphs, and bookmarks, and coordinating the complete buffer rendering with proper face application and formatting.

## Implementation Summary
The rendering system provides a complete visual layer for displaying jj repository status in a Magit-inspired format. The implementation follows existing Emacs conventions for buffer manipulation and face application, using text properties via the `propertize` function for styling. The system renders three main sections (Working Copy, Revisions, Bookmarks) with proper formatting, bold/grey change ID styling, and ASCII graph character preservation. All rendering functions work with parsed data structures (plists) from Task Group 2, maintaining a clean separation between data parsing and presentation.

The implementation emphasizes simplicity and reusability. Each rendering function handles one specific aspect: section headers, individual sections, change ID formatting, etc. The main coordinator function (`jj-status--render-buffer`) orchestrates these components to produce the complete buffer output. All 14 tests pass, verifying section ordering, face application, and graceful handling of empty data.

## Key Implementation Details

### Face Definitions (lines 68-90 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Defined four custom faces following Emacs face conventions:
- `jj-status-section-heading`: Bold keyword face for section headers
- `jj-status-change-id-unique`: Bold constant face for unique change ID prefix
- `jj-status-change-id-suffix`: Shadow face for dimmed/grey change ID suffix
- `jj-status-graph`: Comment face for ASCII graph characters

**Rationale:** These faces inherit from standard Emacs faces (font-lock-keyword-face, font-lock-constant-face, shadow, font-lock-comment-face) to ensure compatibility with user color themes and maintain consistency with Emacs conventions. The use of `:inherit` allows themes to automatically apply appropriate colors.

### Section Header Rendering (lines 402-411 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Implemented `jj-status--render-section-header` function that inserts a title with the `jj-status-section-heading` face and adds a blank line after. Uses `propertize` to apply text properties.

**Rationale:** Separating header rendering into its own function promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes all sections use consistent header formatting. The blank line after headers provides visual separation between the header and content.

### Change ID Formatting (lines 413-437 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Implemented `jj-status--format-change-id` function that splits change IDs at character 8, applying bold face to the first 8 characters (unique prefix) and grey face to the remainder (suffix). Returns a fully propertized string ready for insertion.

**Rationale:** This simplified approach uses a fixed 8-character prefix length for consistency and performance, avoiding the need to query jj for each change ID during rendering. The `jj-status--determine-unique-prefix` function from Task Group 2 can be used when more precision is needed, but for rendering purposes, a fixed split provides visual consistency and faster performance.

### Working Copy Section (lines 439-459 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Implemented `jj-status--render-working-copy` function that renders the "Working Copy Changes" section with file entries formatted as "  [STATUS]  [path]" using 2-space indentation. Handles empty file lists gracefully by displaying "(no changes)".

**Rationale:** The two-space indentation creates visual hierarchy, making file entries clearly subordinate to the section header. The status indicator (M, A, R, etc.) is positioned consistently for easy scanning. The "(no changes)" placeholder prevents confusing empty sections.

### Revisions Section (lines 461-502 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Implemented `jj-status--render-revisions` function that renders the "Revisions (immutable_heads()..@)" section with graph visualization. For each revision, inserts:
1. Graph line prefix with `jj-status-graph` face
2. Formatted change ID with bold/grey styling
3. Description text
4. Bookmarks in [bracket] format when present

**Rationale:** This function preserves the ASCII graph structure from jj's output by keeping graph characters intact and applying consistent faces. Bookmarks are displayed inline with revisions to show which revisions have branch/bookmark associations. The graph face helps visually distinguish structure from content.

### Bookmarks Section (lines 504-525 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Implemented `jj-status--render-bookmarks` function that renders the "Bookmarks" section with entries formatted as "  [name]  → [change-id]" using an arrow separator. Handles empty bookmark lists with "(no bookmarks)" placeholder.

**Rationale:** The arrow (→) provides clear visual indication of the relationship between bookmark name and change ID. Two-space indentation matches the working copy section for consistency. The format is concise and easy to scan.

### Buffer Rendering Coordinator (lines 527-561 in jj.el)
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el`

Implemented `jj-status--render-buffer` function as the main coordinator that:
1. Clears existing buffer content with `inhibit-read-only`
2. Inserts buffer title "jj: [project-name]" with section-heading face
3. Calls section rendering functions in order: Working Copy, Revisions, Bookmarks
4. Manages read-only state appropriately

**Rationale:** This function provides a single entry point for rendering the complete buffer, making it easy to refresh or initially render. The use of `inhibit-read-only` within a `let` binding ensures read-only protection is re-established even if an error occurs during rendering. Section ordering matches the spec: working copy first (most immediately relevant), then revisions (historical context), then bookmarks (references).

## Database Changes
Not applicable (Emacs Lisp package, no database)

## Dependencies
None - all dependencies were already present in the project (Emacs 28.1+, transient.el, s.el)

## Testing

### Test Files Created

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### /home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Each rendering function follows single responsibility principle - `jj-status--render-section-header` only handles headers, `jj-status--format-change-id` only handles change ID formatting, etc. Functions are reusable across different contexts (e.g., section header function is called by all three section renderers). The main coordinator function (`jj-status--render-buffer`) demonstrates composability by combining smaller rendering functions. All functions have clear interfaces via docstrings with explicit input/output documentation.

**Deviations:** None

### /home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Custom faces follow Emacs conventions by inheriting from standard font-lock faces rather than defining colors directly. This respects the user's chosen theme and avoids overriding framework (Emacs) styling. The face definitions are minimal and leverage Emacs' built-in shadow, font-lock-keyword-face, and font-lock-constant-face for consistency across themes. No custom CSS-equivalent styling was needed beyond these face definitions.

**Deviations:** None

### /home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All functions use consistent naming with the `jj-status--` prefix for internal functions. Meaningful names are used throughout (`render-section-header`, `format-change-id`, `render-working-copy`) that clearly indicate purpose. Functions are small and focused on single tasks (e.g., `render-section-header` only handles header rendering). Consistent 2-space indentation is maintained throughout. No dead code or commented-out blocks were introduced. The implementation avoids duplication by extracting common header rendering logic into `jj-status--render-section-header`.

**Deviations:** None

### /home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All text content uses semantic Emacs faces (keyword, constant, shadow, comment) which screen readers can interpret. Visual information (colors, bold) is supplemented with structural information (section headers, consistent formatting). Graph characters use ASCII art which is readable without color. Text-based navigation will work with screen readers since all content is plain text with semantic structure.

**Deviations:** None

### /home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The buffer uses monospace text which adapts naturally to different window widths. Long descriptions will wrap appropriately based on window width. Graph alignment is maintained through consistent spacing. No fixed-width elements that would break at different window sizes.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Buffer Management
- Follows existing buffer creation pattern from `jj-status` function
- Uses `inhibit-read-only` pattern consistent with existing code
- Buffer naming follows "jj: [project-name]" convention

### Data Structures
- Consumes plist structures defined in Task Group 2
- Revision plists: `(:graph-line :change-id :description :bookmarks)`
- File plists: `(:path :status)`
- Bookmark plists: `(:name :change-id)`

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None

### Limitations
1. **Fixed 8-character prefix split**
   - Description: Change ID formatting uses a fixed 8-character split rather than querying jj for true unique prefix length
   - Reason: Performance and simplicity - rendering should be fast and not require additional jj commands
   - Future Consideration: Could integrate with `jj-status--determine-unique-prefix` from Task Group 2 if users need more precise prefix highlighting

2. **No file change summary in revisions**
   - Description: Revisions section doesn't display file change counts (e.g., "Added: 2, Modified: 3")
   - Reason: This information isn't currently provided in the parsed revision plists
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 2 parsing could be extended to extract file change statistics, then rendering could display them

## Performance Considerations
All rendering functions perform direct buffer insertion without intermediate string concatenation, minimizing memory allocation. Face properties are applied during insertion using `propertize`, avoiding separate property-setting passes. The fixed 8-character change ID split avoids querying jj for each revision. Testing shows all 95 tests (including 14 rendering tests) complete in 7.08ms.

## Security Considerations
All input is already parsed and validated by Task Group 2 functions. No user input is directly inserted into the buffer. No shell commands are executed during rendering. All text insertion uses safe Emacs Lisp functions (`insert`, `propertize`).

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 4 (Navigation)**: Will need to add text properties during rendering to support navigation (see task 4.3: modify rendering functions to call `jj-status--mark-item-bounds`)
- **Task Group 6 (Refresh)**: Will use `jj-status--render-buffer` as the main re-rendering entry point

## Notes
The rendering system is designed to be stateless - it takes parsed data and produces visual output without maintaining internal state. This makes it easy to refresh the buffer by simply re-fetching data, re-parsing, and re-rendering. The separation between data collection (Task Group 1), parsing (Task Group 2), and rendering (Task Group 3) creates a clean pipeline architecture that will support the refresh functionality in Task Group 6.

All rendering functions follow the convention of working within the current buffer rather than creating their own buffers. This allows `jj-status--render-buffer` to control buffer creation and management while delegating rendering logic to focused helper functions.

The 14 focused tests provide confidence in the rendering logic without requiring visual verification or browser-based testing (since this is an Emacs package). All tests run quickly and verify both individual function behavior and integrated buffer rendering.
