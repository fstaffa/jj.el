- Interactive Navigation: n/p for navigation, RET for diff CORRECTLY documented (line 129)
- Section Folding: Correctly marked as out of scope (deferred) - line 219
- Refresh Behavior: Manual 'g' and auto-refresh after specific commands CORRECTLY documented (lines 134-137)
- Integration with Existing Commands: No integration besides 's' for staging CORRECTLY specified (line 128)

**Reusability Opportunities:**
- PASSED: Extensive documentation of existing code to reuse (lines 64-95, 182-200)
- All referenced components exist and are properly documented with line numbers

### Check 2: Visual Assets
**Status:** NOT APPLICABLE

No visual assets found in planning/visuals folder (expected, as this is terminal-based UI).
Requirements.md correctly notes "No visual assets provided" (line 99).

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
**Status:** NOT APPLICABLE

No visual files to analyze. The spec provides ASCII art mockup in spec.md (lines 93-117), which is appropriate for terminal UI design.

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage

**Explicit Features Requested:**
- Revision display from immutable to @ with revset: PASSED (spec.md lines 22-24)
- Working Copy section: PASSED (spec.md line 20)
- Revisions section: PASSED (spec.md line 22)
- Bookmarks section: PASSED (spec.md line 23)
- File-level staging with 's' key: PASSED (spec.md lines 37-42)
- Navigation with n/p and RET: PASSED (spec.md lines 45-48)
- Manual refresh with 'g': PASSED (spec.md line 49)
- Auto-refresh after describe/abandon/squash/new: PASSED (spec.md lines 54-59)
- Change ID with bold unique prefix: PASSED (spec.md lines 30, 63-68)
- ASCII graph visualization: PASSED (spec.md lines 27-34)
- Commit hash display: NOTE - User asked for this but NOT in spec.md revision display

**Reusability Opportunities:**
- PASSED: jj-status-mode referenced (spec.md line 152)
- PASSED: jj--with-command macro referenced (spec.md line 158)
- PASSED: jj--run-command referenced (spec.md line 162)
- PASSED: Error handling infrastructure referenced (spec.md lines 167-171)
- PASSED: Buffer management pattern referenced (spec.md lines 173-177)
- PASSED: Transient integration referenced (spec.md lines 179-183)

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
- PASSED: Inline diff viewing correctly excluded (spec.md line 374)
- PASSED: Hunk-level staging correctly excluded (spec.md line 375)
- PASSED: Section folding correctly excluded (spec.md line 378)
- PASSED: Conflict resolution UI correctly excluded (spec.md line 377)
- PASSED: All user-confirmed out-of-scope items properly listed

**Minor Discrepancy:**
- User asked for "Commit hash" in revision display (Q4 in user Q&A)
- spec.md line 29 shows "Change ID" but does NOT mention commit hash separately
- This is MINOR because Change ID is the primary identifier in jj, but worth noting

### Check 5: Core Specification Issues
**Status:** PASSED WITH MINOR NOTE

- **Goal alignment:** PASSED - Matches user need for Magit-like interface (spec.md lines 3-5)
- **User stories:** PASSED - All stories trace to user requirements (spec.md lines 7-13)
- **Core requirements:** PASSED - All functional requirements from user discussion present (spec.md lines 15-76)
- **Out of scope:** PASSED - Correctly matches user-stated exclusions (spec.md lines 369-402)
- **Reusability notes:** PASSED - Comprehensive section on reusable components (spec.md lines 147-223)

**Minor Note:**
- Commit hash not explicitly mentioned in revision display section
- User's Q4 answer requested: "Change ID (abbreviated), Commit hash, Commit description, Author and date, Graph visualization"
- spec.md line 29 only mentions "Change ID with bold unique prefix"
- requirements.md line 19 also only mentions Change ID
- This may be intentional (jj uses Change ID as primary identifier) but should be verified

### Check 6: Task List Detailed Validation

- Task Group 8: 5 tasks PASSED (within 3-10 range)
- Task Group 9: 5 tasks PASSED (within 3-10 range)

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Status:** PASSED

**Unnecessary New Components:**
- NONE IDENTIFIED - All new components are necessary:
  - Status buffer renderer (new requirement, no existing equivalent)
  - Navigation system (new requirement, no existing multi-section navigation)
  - Staging logic (new requirement, no existing staging in jj.el)
  - Revision metadata parser (new requirement, specific format needed)

**Duplicated Logic:**
- NONE IDENTIFIED - Tasks explicitly reference existing components:
  - jj--with-command for command execution (not recreated)
  - jj--run-command for CLI invocation (not recreated)
  - jj-status-mode as base (extended, not replaced)
  - Error handling infrastructure (reused, not duplicated)

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
- NONE IDENTIFIED - All major reusable components are documented and referenced:
  - Command execution macros
  - Buffer management patterns
  - Error handling infrastructure
  - Transient menu system
  - Mode definition patterns

**Justification for New Code:**
- PASSED: All new code serves unique requirements:
  - Multi-section buffer rendering (doesn't exist)
  - ASCII graph integration (new visualization)
  - File staging workflow (new capability)
  - Navigation across sections (new interaction model)

## Critical Issues
**Status:** NONE

No critical issues identified that would block implementation.

## Minor Issues

### Issue 1: Commit Hash Not Explicitly Mentioned
**Severity:** MINOR
**Location:** spec.md line 29, requirements.md line 19
**Description:** User's Q4 answer requested "Commit hash" as part of revision display, but spec only mentions "Change ID". This may be intentional (jj uses Change ID as primary) but should be clarified.
**Recommendation:** Verify with user whether commit hash should be displayed separately from Change ID, or if Change ID alone is sufficient.

### Issue 2: Author and Date Not in Spec Revision Display Section
**Severity:** MINOR
**Location:** spec.md lines 27-34
**Description:** User's Q4 answer requested "Author and date" in revision display, but spec.md lines 27-34 don't explicitly list these fields (though line 119 in Visual Design mockup shows they're not included).
**Recommendation:** Verify this is intentional omission or add to revision display requirements.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
**Status:** NONE IDENTIFIED

The specification appropriately:
- Reuses existing infrastructure (command execution, error handling, modes)
- Creates only necessary new components (no gold-plating)
- Follows existing patterns and conventions
- Maintains reasonable scope without feature creep
- Defers complex features appropriately (inline diff, conflict resolution)

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

**Tech Stack Compliance:**
- PASSED: The tech-stack.md file is a template with no specific requirements for this project
- PASSED: Code uses Emacs Lisp as appropriate for the project
- PASSED: Testing uses Buttercup as specified in CLAUDE.md

**Coding Style Compliance:**
- PASSED: Spec follows DRY principle by reusing existing components
- PASSED: Functions are small and focused (single-purpose per task)
- PASSED: Naming conventions follow jj-- prefix pattern for internal functions
- PASSED: No dead code (all new code serves defined requirements)
- PASSED: No backward compatibility requirements stated

**Test Writing Compliance:**
- PASSED: Tasks follow "Write Minimal Tests During Development" principle
- PASSED: Each task group writes 2-8 focused tests only
- PASSED: Tests focus on core user flows (staging, navigation, refresh)
- PASSED: Edge case testing explicitly deferred (tasks.md lines 38, 74, 198, 255)
- PASSED: Tests run only newly written tests, not entire suite
- PASSED: Testing-engineer adds maximum 10 strategic tests
- PASSED: Total expected tests (24-66) is reasonable for feature scope

## Recommendations

1. **Clarify Commit Hash Display** - Verify with user whether commit hash should be displayed in addition to Change ID in revision listings, as mentioned in original Q4 answer.

2. **Clarify Author/Date Display** - Verify whether author and date should be included in revision display (Q4 mentioned these but mockup in spec doesn't show them).

3. **Consider Adding Task for Commit Hash** - If commit hash display is confirmed, add parsing and rendering subtasks to relevant task groups.

4. **Update ASCII Mockup if Needed** - If author/date/commit-hash are to be included, update the visual design mockup in spec.md lines 93-117.

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION WITH MINOR CLARIFICATIONS**

The specification and task list accurately reflect the user's requirements from the requirements gathering conversation. All major features are properly captured, reusability opportunities are extensively documented, and the testing approach follows the limited testing philosophy appropriately.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent requirements coverage - all user answers captured
- Comprehensive reusability documentation with specific line numbers
- Test writing approach strictly follows 2-8 tests per group methodology
- Clear task breakdown with proper dependencies
- Strong adherence to existing code patterns
- No over-engineering or unnecessary new components
- Proper scope management with clear out-of-scope items

**Minor Clarifications Needed:**
- Commit hash display (mentioned in Q4 but not in spec revision display section)
- Author/date display (mentioned in Q4 but not in mockup)

These clarifications are MINOR and do NOT block implementation. The team can proceed with implementation using the current spec, with a quick user confirmation on the two display questions to ensure completeness.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation after obtaining quick clarification on commit hash and author/date display requirements.
