# Task 1: Command Execution Infrastructure

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-error-handling-standardization/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Establish the foundation by replacing `shell-command-to-string` with `call-process` and implementing the new command execution wrapper that returns structured results including exit codes and separated stdout/stderr.

## Implementation Summary

Task Group 1 was already implemented prior to this work session. The implementation includes:

1. **Command Execution Infrastructure**: The `jj--run-command` function was already refactored to use `call-process` instead of `shell-command-to-string`, enabling proper exit code capture and stderr separation.

2. **Configuration Variables**: Both `jj-debug-mode` and `jj-error-buffer-name` were already defined as `defcustom` variables with proper documentation.

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 4 focused tests were already written for the new command execution wrapper, covering all critical behaviors (success, failure, stdout/stderr separation, execution directory).

The implementation correctly returns a structured result in the format `(success-flag stdout stderr exit-code)`, where success-flag is a boolean (t for exit code 0, nil otherwise). All 4 tests pass successfully, validating the implementation meets the acceptance criteria.

## Key Implementation Details

### Command Execution Wrapper
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` (lines 70-94)

The `jj--run-command` function uses `call-process` with temporary buffers for stdout and stderr capture. Key implementation aspects:

- Creates temporary buffers with space prefix (` *jj-stdout*`, ` *jj-stderr*`) to keep them hidden
- Uses `unwind-protect` to ensure buffers are cleaned up even if errors occur
- Splits command string into arguments list using `split-string`
- Prepends standard jj flags (`--no-pager --color never`) to all commands
- Executes from project root by binding `default-directory` to result of `jj--get-project-folder`
- Returns structured list: `(success-flag stdout stderr exit-code)`

**Rationale:** This approach provides complete control over command execution, enables proper error handling by capturing exit codes, and maintains backward compatibility with the existing command construction pattern.

### Configuration Variables
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/jj.el` (lines 28-42)

Two configuration variables were defined using `defcustom`:

1. `jj-debug-mode` (boolean, default: nil) - Controls debug logging to *Messages* buffer
2. `jj-error-buffer-name` (string, default: "*jj-errors*") - Name of buffer for detailed error context

Both include comprehensive documentation strings explaining their purpose and usage.

**Rationale:** Using `defcustom` follows Emacs conventions and allows users to customize these values through the standard customization interface.

### Test Suite
**Location:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` (lines 239-308)

The test suite includes 4 comprehensive tests using the data-driven plist pattern:

1. **Success with exit code 0** - Verifies successful command returns (t, stdout, "", 0)
2. **Failure with non-zero exit** - Verifies failed command returns (nil, "", stderr, 1)
3. **Stdout/stderr separation** - Verifies both streams are captured separately
4. **Execution directory** - Verifies command runs from project root

Tests mock `call-process` using `cl-letf` to avoid requiring jj binary installation, and verify:
- Structured return format matches spec
- Command construction includes --no-pager and --color never flags
- Execution happens from correct project directory
- Exit codes are properly captured and converted to boolean success flags

**Rationale:** Data-driven tests reduce duplication and follow the existing test pattern established in the codebase. Mocking ensures tests run fast and in isolation.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

Not applicable - no database in this Emacs package.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### New Dependencies Added
None - implementation uses only built-in Emacs Lisp functions.

### Configuration Changes
Two new defcustom variables added (documented above), but no environment variables or external configuration required.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/tests/test-jj.el` - Tests already existed in lines 239-308

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Complete (4/4 tests passing)
- Integration tests: Not applicable for this task group
- Edge cases covered:
  - Success case (exit 0)
  - Failure case (exit non-zero)
  - Stdout/stderr separation
  - Directory execution context

### Manual Testing Performed
Ran the 4 focused tests for the new command execution wrapper:

```bash
eask test buttercup
```

Result: All 4 tests in "jj--run-command (new implementation)" suite passed:
- "should return success with exit code 0" - PASSED (0.15ms)
- "should return failure with non-zero exit code" - PASSED (0.13ms)
- "should capture stdout and stderr separately" - PASSED (0.13ms)
- "should execute from project directory" - PASSED (0.13ms)

Note: Other tests in the suite failed because they expect the old return format (string instead of structured list), but those failures are expected and will be addressed in Task Group 4 (function migration) and Task Group 5 (test suite update).

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Coding Style
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The implementation follows all coding style standards:
- **Consistent naming**: Uses double-dash prefix for internal function (`jj--run-command`)
- **Meaningful names**: Function and variable names clearly describe their purpose
- **Small, focused functions**: `jj--run-command` has single responsibility (execute command and return structured result)
- **DRY principle**: Command construction logic (--no-pager --color never) is centralized
- **No dead code**: Implementation removed old `shell-command-to-string` approach entirely

**Deviations:** None.

### Global Error Handling
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Fail fast**: Uses `unwind-protect` to ensure resources (buffers) are cleaned up even on errors
- **Clean up resources**: Buffers are killed in the `unwind-protect` cleanup form
- **Specific error types**: Return structure enables callers to distinguish success from failure
- **Graceful degradation**: Foundation established for future error categorization (Task Group 2)

**Deviations:** None. Error signaling and categorization will be added in Task Group 2 as planned.

### Testing Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Minimal tests**: Only 4 focused tests written, covering core behaviors
- **Test core flows**: Tests focus on critical path (command execution with various outcomes)
- **Defer edge cases**: Skipped exhaustive edge case testing as instructed
- **Mock dependencies**: All tests mock `call-process` to avoid requiring jj binary
- **Fast execution**: All 4 tests complete in <1ms total

**Deviations:** None.

### Backend API Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/mathematician314/data/personal/jj.el/agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Not directly applicable - this file contains web API standards (RESTful design, HTTP methods), while this is an Emacs Lisp package. However, the spirit of the standards is followed:
- **Consistent naming**: Function names follow Emacs Lisp conventions
- **Appropriate return values**: Returns structured data that accurately reflects the operation result

**Deviations:** None.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### Internal Dependencies
This implementation serves as the foundation for all other task groups:
- Task Group 2 (Error Handling Functions) depends on the structured return format
- Task Group 3 (Debug Logging System) depends on command execution infrastructure
- Task Group 4 (Function Migration) depends on the new return format
- Task Group 5 (Test Suite Update) depends on all above

The structured return format `(success-flag stdout stderr exit-code)` provides the data needed for:
- Error categorization (exit codes, stderr content)
- Debug logging (command execution details)
- Error buffer writing (complete command context)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None - all acceptance criteria met and tests passing.

### Limitations
1. **Breaking change for callers**
   - Description: Functions calling `jj--run-command` expect old string return value
   - Impact: 17 tests fail because callers haven't been migrated yet
   - Reason: This is intentional - migration happens in Task Group 4
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 4 will update all callers to use new format

2. **Synchronous execution only**
   - Description: Commands execute synchronously, blocking Emacs
   - Reason: Spec explicitly requires synchronous execution for predictable control flow
   - Future Consideration: This is by design and not a limitation to address

## Performance Considerations

The implementation uses temporary buffers which are created and destroyed for each command execution. This is acceptable because:
- Commands are typically infrequent (user-initiated actions)
- Buffer creation/destruction overhead is negligible for Emacs
- Synchronous execution is required by spec, so no async optimization possible

The use of `call-process` is more efficient than `shell-command-to-string` because it avoids spawning an intermediate shell process.

## Security Considerations

The implementation properly handles command arguments by:
- Using `split-string` to parse command into argument list
- Passing arguments directly to `call-process` (no shell interpretation)
- Not constructing shell command strings that could be vulnerable to injection

Temporary buffers use space-prefixed names to keep them hidden from normal buffer lists.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This task is a foundation for:
- **Task Group 2** (lines 49-92 in tasks.md): Error handling functions depend on exit codes and stderr
- **Task Group 3** (lines 94-133 in tasks.md): Debug logging depends on command execution infrastructure
- **Task Group 4** (lines 135-198 in tasks.md): Function migration depends on new return format
- **Task Group 5** (lines 200-256 in tasks.md): Test suite updates depend on all infrastructure

## Notes

This task group was found to be already implemented when work began. The implementation quality is high:
- Follows all Emacs Lisp conventions
- Uses appropriate patterns (unwind-protect for resource cleanup)
- Includes comprehensive test coverage
- Properly documented with docstrings

The 17 failing tests are expected and documented - they represent code that hasn't been migrated yet to use the new structured return format. This migration is explicitly scoped to Task Group 4, making this a clean separation of concerns.

The implementation successfully establishes the foundation for robust error handling in jj.el while maintaining consistency with existing code patterns and Emacs Lisp best practices.
