# Spec Requirements: Error Handling Standardization

## Initial Description
Standardize error handling across the jj.el codebase to ensure consistent error messages, proper error propagation, and user-friendly error reporting.

## Requirements Discussion

### First Round Questions

**Q1:** What are the main pain points you're experiencing with current error handling? For example, are errors being swallowed silently, or are error messages too technical for end users?
**Answer:** No current pain points - this is about setting up a good foundation

**Q2:** Should we categorize errors into different types (user errors, command failures, system errors) to handle them differently?
**Answer:** Yes, use the three categories: User errors, Command failures, System errors

**Q3:** For user-facing error messages, I'm assuming we should use Emacs' standard `message` for informational errors and `user-error` for user-actionable problems. Should we also create a dedicated error buffer for detailed error logs?
**Answer:** Yes, use `message` for minor issues, `user-error` for user-actionable problems, `error` for serious system issues. No dedicated error buffer for now.

**Q4:** Should we implement debug logging that can be toggled on/off? For example, a `jj-debug-mode` variable that logs all command executions and their results to the `*Messages*` buffer?
**Answer:** Yes, use `*Messages*` buffer with a debug flag (like `jj-debug-mode`). Log failed commands with details.

**Q5:** For command execution errors, should we capture both stdout and stderr separately? I'm thinking we should use `call-process` with separate output buffers to distinguish between command output and error messages.
**Answer:** Use `call-process` (synchronous, with exit codes and separate stdout/stderr)

**Q6:** Should we add validation checks before executing commands? For example, checking if we're in a jj repository before running jj commands, and showing a friendly "Not in a jj repository" message?
**Answer:** Yes, check for .jj folder before command execution and show "Not in a jj repository" message

**Q7:** For transient or network-related errors, should we implement retry logic with exponential backoff, or just fail fast and let the user retry manually?
**Answer:** No automatic retry or recovery mechanisms

**Q8:** Should error context be preserved for debugging? For example, storing the full command that failed, its exit code, and stderr output in case users need to report issues?
**Answer:** Yes, preserve full stderr output, exit code, and command. Use a special buffer (like `*jj-errors*`) for detailed error information

**Q9:** Since this is a standardization effort, should we maintain backward compatibility with existing function signatures, or can we make breaking changes to improve the error handling API?
**Answer:** Yes, make any changes needed to function signatures and error behavior (early stage project, v0.0.1)

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- Implement three-tier error categorization system:
  - User errors (wrong input, invalid operations)
  - Command failures (jj command execution problems)
  - System errors (serious internal issues)
- Use appropriate Emacs error signaling:
  - `message` for minor/informational issues
  - `user-error` for user-actionable problems
  - `error` for serious system issues
- Implement debug mode with configurable logging:
  - Toggle via `jj-debug-mode` variable
  - Log to `*Messages*` buffer
  - Include details for failed commands
- Use synchronous command execution via `call-process`:
  - Capture exit codes
  - Separate stdout and stderr handling
- Validate repository context before command execution:
  - Check for .jj folder presence
  - Display friendly "Not in a jj repository" message
- Preserve comprehensive error context:
  - Full stderr output
  - Exit code
  - Command that failed
  - Store in dedicated `*jj-errors*` buffer for detailed information
- No automatic retry or recovery mechanisms

### Reusability Opportunities
Not applicable - foundational standardization work.

### Scope Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Standardized error categorization (user, command, system)
- Consistent error signaling mechanisms
- Debug logging infrastructure with toggle
- Repository validation before commands
- Error context preservation and storage
- Breaking changes to function signatures as needed

**Out of Scope:**
- Dedicated error buffer for routine display (using `*jj-errors*` only for detailed context)
- Automatic retry or recovery mechanisms
- Network error handling with exponential backoff
- Backward compatibility with existing APIs

### Technical Considerations
- Early stage project (v0.0.1), breaking changes acceptable
- Use standard Emacs error functions (`message`, `user-error`, `error`)
- Use `call-process` for synchronous command execution
- Separate buffer management for errors (`*jj-errors*`) and messages (`*Messages*`)
- Repository detection via .jj folder presence check
