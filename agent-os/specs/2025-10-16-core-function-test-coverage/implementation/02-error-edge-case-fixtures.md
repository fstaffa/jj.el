# Task 2: Error and Edge Case Fixtures

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-core-function-test-coverage/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Create organized test fixture structure with subdirectories for error scenarios and edge cases. This task involved creating realistic jj command output fixtures to support comprehensive testing of error handling and edge case behavior in future test suites.

## Implementation Summary
Implemented a comprehensive fixture organization system by creating two subdirectories under `tests/fixtures/` to categorize error scenarios and edge cases separately. Created 8 new fixture files containing realistic jj command outputs that simulate various error conditions and edge case scenarios. Updated the test-helper.el documentation to reflect the new fixture organization and provide clear guidance on loading fixtures from subdirectories.

The fixtures were designed to be reusable across multiple test cases and follow the existing naming convention of kebab-case descriptive names. All error fixtures contain authentic-looking error messages that match the actual jj command-line tool's error output format, while edge case fixtures contain valid but boundary-condition data to test parser robustness.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `tests/fixtures/errors/invalid-project-no-jj.txt` - Error message when .jj directory is missing from project
- `tests/fixtures/errors/command-not-found.txt` - Shell error when jj binary is not found in PATH
- `tests/fixtures/errors/malformed-bookmark-output.txt` - Corrupted jj output with syntax errors
- `tests/fixtures/errors/empty-log-output.txt` - Empty output representing no revisions in log
- `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/bookmarks-with-special-chars.txt` - Bookmarks containing slashes, hyphens, underscores, dots
- `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/very-long-bookmark-name.txt` - Single bookmark with 197 character name
- `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/status-with-many-changes.txt` - Status output with 25+ file changes of various types
- `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/log-single-revision.txt` - Minimal log output with exactly one revision

### Modified Files
- `tests/test-helper.el` - Updated fixture documentation section (lines 116-142) to include new fixture subdirectories and list all available fixtures organized by category

### Deleted Files
None

## Key Implementation Details

### Fixture Directory Structure
**Location:** `tests/fixtures/errors/` and `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/`

Created two subdirectories to organize fixtures by purpose:
- `errors/` - Contains fixtures representing error conditions and failure scenarios
- `edge-cases/` - Contains fixtures representing boundary conditions and stress test scenarios

This organization keeps the flat structure for existing fixtures intact for backward compatibility while providing clear categorization for new fixtures.

**Rationale:** Organizing fixtures by category makes it easier for developers to find appropriate test data and understand fixture purpose at a glance. The subdirectory approach scales well as more fixtures are added in the future.

### Error Scenario Fixtures
**Location:** `tests/fixtures/errors/`

Created 4 error fixtures representing common failure modes:

1. `invalid-project-no-jj.txt` - Contains error message "Error: There is no jj repo in ".""
   - Simulates the error when jj commands are run outside a jj repository

2. `command-not-found.txt` - Contains "/usr/bin/env: 'jj': No such file or directory"
   - Simulates shell error when jj binary is not installed or not in PATH

3. `malformed-bookmark-output.txt` - Contains realistic jj parse error with context
   - Includes syntax error message with line number and position markers
   - Simulates corrupted or invalid jj command output

4. `empty-log-output.txt` - Empty file (0 bytes)
   - Represents the case where no revisions match the log query

**Rationale:** These fixtures enable testing of error handling paths without requiring actual error conditions to be triggered. The error messages match authentic jj output format for realistic testing.

### Edge Case Fixtures
**Location:** `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/`

Created 4 edge case fixtures to stress test parsing and display logic:

1. `bookmarks-with-special-chars.txt` - Contains 8 bookmarks with special characters
   - Includes slashes (feature/new-ui), hyphens (fix bug-123), underscores (dev_branch)
   - Tests parser robustness with realistic branch naming patterns

2. `very-long-bookmark-name.txt` - Single bookmark with 197 characters
   - Tests handling of exceptionally long bookmark names
   - Verifies no buffer overflow or truncation issues

3. `status-with-many-changes.txt` - Status output with 25+ file changes
   - Includes Added (A), Modified (M), and Deleted (D) file status markers
   - Tests performance and display of large change sets
   - Contains realistic file paths and status footer

4. `log-single-revision.txt` - Minimal log output with one revision
   - Tests lower boundary of log parsing (minimum valid output)
   - Includes all standard log fields (commit ID, author, timestamp, bookmarks)

**Rationale:** These fixtures test boundary conditions that might expose parser bugs or performance issues. They use valid jj output format but with extreme values to ensure robustness.

### Documentation Updates
**Location:** `tests/test-helper.el` (lines 116-142)

Updated the "Available Fixtures" section in test-helper.el commentary to document:
- Fixture organization into subdirectories by category
- Complete list of all fixtures in main directory
- Complete list of error scenario fixtures with descriptions
- Complete list of edge case fixtures with descriptions
- Example of loading fixtures from subdirectories using relative paths

Also updated the `jj-test-load-fixture` function documentation (lines 300-340) to explicitly state support for subdirectory paths and provide examples of loading fixtures from subdirectories.

**Rationale:** Comprehensive documentation ensures developers can discover and use fixtures effectively. Examples of subdirectory loading prevent confusion about path syntax.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this task only involves creating static test fixture files.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. This task uses only existing file system operations.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
No test files were created or updated in this task. This task creates the fixture infrastructure that will be used by tests in Task Groups 3 and 4.

### Test Coverage
Not applicable - this task creates test fixtures, not test code.

### Manual Testing Performed
Verified fixture files were created successfully:
- Confirmed `tests/fixtures/errors/` directory exists with 4 fixture files
- Confirmed `tests/fixtures/edge-cases/` directory exists with 4 fixture files
- Verified file contents match the intended error messages and edge case scenarios

- Verified fixture names follow kebab-case naming convention

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Coding Style
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Fixture files use meaningful descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `bookmarks-with-special-chars.txt`, `invalid-project-no-jj.txt`). File organization follows a logical structure with subdirectories for categorization. Documentation updates use clear, concise language with concrete examples.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Commenting Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Updated test-helper.el documentation includes clear explanations of the fixture organization, purpose of each fixture category, and usage examples. Comments explain both what the fixtures contain and why they're organized this way.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Conventions
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Fixture filenames follow consistent kebab-case naming convention established in the spec. Directory structure follows Unix conventions with lowercase names and forward slashes. Fixture content matches realistic jj command output format.

**Deviations:** None

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
This task creates fixtures for testing core user flows (error handling) and critical edge cases (boundary conditions) as prioritized in the standards. Fixtures enable focused testing of specific scenarios without requiring actual error conditions or edge cases to be triggered in production code.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies
These fixtures will be used by:
- Task Group 3 tests (Core Function Test Suites) - will use edge case fixtures for testing parsing robustness
- Task Group 4 tests (Coverage Analysis) - will use error fixtures for testing error handling paths

The fixtures integrate with the existing test infrastructure through the `jj-test-load-fixture` function, which now supports loading fixtures from subdirectories using relative paths like "errors/command-not-found.txt".

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified.

### Limitations
1. **Limited Error Coverage**
   - Description: Only 4 error scenarios are covered (project detection, command not found, malformed output, empty output)
   - Reason: Task scope focused on most common error conditions to keep fixture set manageable
   - Future Consideration: Additional error fixtures can be added as needed for specific test cases

2. **Edge Cases Not Exhaustive**
   - Description: Only 4 edge case scenarios are covered (special chars, long names, many changes, single revision)
   - Reason: Following test writing standards to focus on business-critical edge cases only
   - Future Consideration: Additional edge cases can be added based on actual bugs discovered or specific testing needs

## Performance Considerations
Fixture files are small (all under 1KB except status-with-many-changes.txt at ~627 bytes), ensuring fast load times during test execution. The subdirectory organization has no performance impact on fixture loading.

## Security Considerations
All fixtures contain only example data with no real credentials, paths, or sensitive information. The fixtures use placeholder values like "test@example.com" for email addresses and example paths like "/tmp/test-project/".

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task is a dependency for:
- Task Group 3.3 - User interaction function tests will use edge case fixtures
- Task Group 4.3 - Strategic gap-filling tests will use error fixtures to test error handling paths

## Notes
All acceptance criteria for Task Group 2 have been met:
- Two fixture subdirectories created (errors/, edge-cases/)
- 4 error scenario fixtures created with realistic error messages
- 4 edge case fixtures created with valid but boundary-condition data
- All fixtures contain realistic jj command output format
- Fixture documentation updated in test-helper.el with complete listing and usage examples

The fixtures are ready for use in subsequent testing tasks and follow all established patterns and conventions from the existing test infrastructure.
