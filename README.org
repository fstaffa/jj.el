[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] like interface to [[https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/][Jujutsu]] version control system. Current goal is to use this project to learn more about both Emacs packages and Jujutsu.

There are currently more feature complete implementations for Jujutsu:
- [[https://github.com/bennyandresen/jujutsu.el][jujutsu.el]] - Magit like interface
- [[https://codeberg.org/emacs-jj-vc/vc-jj.el][vc-jj.el]] - ~vc.el~ integration

** Features

*** Status Buffer

The status buffer provides a Magit-inspired interface for viewing and managing your jj repository state. It displays three main sections: Working Copy Changes, Revisions, and Bookmarks, with an ASCII graph visualization of your revision stack.

The status buffer implements a "last described revision" staging workflow: when you stage a file with ~s~, it automatically moves to the most recent revision that has a description (not "no description set"). This enables efficient organization of changes across your revision stack without manual target selection.

**** Keybindings

| ~n~   | Next item           | Move to next file or revision                 |
| ~p~   | Previous item       | Move to previous file or revision             |
| ~s~   | Stage file          | Stage file at point to last described revision|
| ~g~   | Refresh             | Manually refresh the status buffer            |
| ~RET~ | Show diff (planned) | Show diff for file or revision at point       |
| ~q~   | Quit                | Close the status buffer window                |

#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Staging Workflow

1. Make changes to multiple files in your working copy
2. Open the status buffer with ~M-x jj-status~
3. Navigate to a file with ~n~ or ~p~
4. Press ~s~ to stage that file to the last revision with a description
5. The buffer auto-refreshes, showing the updated state
6. Repeat for other files to organize changes across your revision stack
